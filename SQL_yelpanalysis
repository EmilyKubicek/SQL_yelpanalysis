Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours (foreign key = hours) = 2052
iii. Category (business_id) = 2643
iv. Attribute (business_id) = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin (business_id) = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend (user_id) = 11
xi. Elite_years (user_id) = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

|   5.0 |                  5 |
+-------+--------------------+


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	-- we are interested in id, name, and review_count
	SELECT id, name,
	review_count
	FROM user
	
	-- order logically for our question/readability

	| -G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw | Gerald    |         2000 |
	| -3s52C4zL_DHRK0ULG6qtg | Sara      |         1629 |
	| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg | Yuri      |         1339 |


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	When examining the review counts of users we can see that those with the
	highest number of fans are not necessarily those with the highest review counts.
	It's difficult to say for sure though, because those with 1 or zero reviews very
	understandably have no fans, so that would likely drive a strong legitimate 
	correlation analysis. In real life or for work I would definitely export this data to
	python and do a simple corr (correlation) analysis.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: love = 1780, hate = 232

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	-- count how many times the word appears in reviews
	SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%'

	-- same as above but with different word
	SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT text)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%hate%';
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	-- find top ten (fans)
	SELECT id,
	name,
	fans
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	+------------------------+-----------+------+
	| id                     | name      | fans |

	+------------------------+-----------+------+
	
	
11. Is there a strong relationship (or correlation) between having a high number of fans and being listed as "useful" or "funny?" Out of the top 10 users with the highest number of fans, what percent are also listed as “useful” or “funny”?

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	We start by first extracting the top ten users with the most fans. Then we see how
	many times those users appear in the top ten for each 'useful' or 'funny' users. We found
	That 5 of the the top ten users with the most fans (Harold, Gerold, Christine, William, Fran)
	are also in the top ten for either being 'useful' or 'funny'. According to the key provided, 
	this means there is a medium relationship between having alor of fans and being 'useful' or 'funny.'

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
If we are looking at business name and city, we can see that those with higher stars (4-5) are medical centers and sit down restaurants. The medical places are open early into the morning, likely to accomodate
the Las Vegas lifestyle. When Looking at the 2-3 star places, they actually have similar hours late into the mornings, but they are more quick service locations (i.e. WingStop, Walgreens).

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
The groups that have 4-5 star ratings have 1042 reviews, while the 2-3 star ratings have 245 reviews.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
When looking at neighborhood data we can see that places in 'Southeast' has 3.5-4 stars and close in the afternoon or early evening. We also see that the business with the highest number of reviews is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Looking at further analyses such as text sentiment analysis could tell us
if it is mostly tourists or locals (or both) frequenting this establishment.


SQL code used for analysis:

-- make columns each variable we are interested inn
SELECT b.city,
b.name,
h.hours,
b.stars,
b.review_count,
b.neighborhood
FROM business b, hours h
-- join to use information in both tables
WHERE b.id = h.business_id AND city = 'Las Vegas'
-- readability/clarity
GROUP BY b.name


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

	
i. Difference 1:
is open = 8480
is closed = 1520
         
ii. Difference 2:
I see a lot of places that are not open are restaurants (by examining the category , which is interesting. It's possible that the market is saturated with restaurants, and thus more difficult to keep open. The 'open' businesses provide a wider variety of business types, suggesting that if you want to go into 
business, maybe you should do so not in a restaurant and/or a very unique restaurant to drive business up.*
*difference 2 observed after joining with 'category' table. See code below         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
-- Count business that are open
SELECT count(is_open)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1

-- Count businesses that are closed
SELECT count(is_open)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0

-- Look at open/closed by category
-- Is open
SELECT b.name, 
c.category,
b.is_open
FROM category AS c, business AS b
WHERE c.business_id = b.id AND is_open = 1
GROUP BY b.name

-- Is closed
SELECT b.name, 
c.category,
b.is_open
FROM category AS c, business AS b
WHERE c.business_id = b.id AND is_open = 1
GROUP BY b.name

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
The analysis I would like to do is parse out keywords for and business attributes for sentiment analysis
for vegan options at restaurants.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

For this analysis I will need the reviews from the Yelp dataset, particularly from restaurants. I chose this
data set because veganism is becoming a larger and larger market for restaurants, even those that are
not created for the vegan population. Although a business may not particularly want to serve this population, it remains that vegan patrons will go to their restaurants and rate/review them. 

By doing sentiment analysis on the reviews for negative/positive emotion, we will be able to see
what customers appreciate about the vegan options, employee knowledge of ingredients, and possibly
lack of vegan knowledge and options. In the final result we will see if those restaurants with more stars do have more options or stay true to their original menu purpose. This will assist new restaurants in deciding how to cater to populations with different diets (i.e. menu options, training employees).

|     5 | --CjIbQXj5-B5LWJp7Hxlw | Love this place!! I'm new to the area and was invited by friends and thought why |				not! The menu has a wide variety including vegan items- I am not vegan but for some |				reason decided to order from the "vegan side" of the menu. The chicken lettuce cups |				were delicious!! Service was fast, friendly staff and kick ass cucumber water 	
|				that's freeeeee! The banana split smoothie is the jam by the way. So happy I found |				a healthy place so close to me! Worth satin again that the staff was really nice 
|				and they all had smiles on their faces!
|     5 | --kwEVaBDLIbWFViVHGleA | Copper Branch satisfied both me and my foodie-vegan friends (clarification: I am |				not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I can get down with tofu when the duty calls), 
|				so if you're looking for a quick spot to satisfy multiple dietary preferences, I 
|				give this place my full endorsement. We were literally standing on a street corner, |				starving and cranky after a long and foodless trek up and back down Mont Royal and |				Rue Peel, when Copper Branch appeared on Yelp and saved the day.
